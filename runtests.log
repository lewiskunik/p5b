**********************************************************************
Summary:
test build PASSED
 (build xv6 using make)

test create PASSED (10 of 10)
 (Creates a small file and makes sure the type is properly set.)

test create2 PASSED (10 of 10)
 (Should not create a small file if O_SMALLFILE is passed in but not O_CREATE.)

test open PASSED (10 of 10)
 (Open() called a second time without O_CREATE and O_SMALLFILE. Checks file's type to make sure it is T_SMALLFILE and that read and write still work)

test read PASSED (10 of 10)
 (Tries to read more than possible and makes sure only amount available is read.)

test read2 FAILED (0 of 10)
 (Reads one byte at a time from small file.)
 tester failed

test write PASSED (10 of 10)
 (Tries to write more than possible to a small file and makes sure only 52 bytes are written.)

test write2 FAILED (0 of 10)
 (Repeatedly opens, writes, closes a small file. The last write should be the one that is persisted.)
 tester failed

test write3 FAILED (0 of 10)
 (Repeatedly opens, writes to the end, closes a small file until file is full.)
 tester failed

test write4 FAILED (0 of 10)
 (Small write followed by a big write to a small file should truncate the big write upto max small file size.)
 tester failed

test readonly PASSED (10 of 10)
 (Makes sure small files can be opened as read only and writes would fail.)

test writeonly PASSED (10 of 10)
 (Makes sure small files can be opened as write only and reads would fail.)

test remove PASSED (10 of 10)
 (Makes sure removing a small file does not corrupt the file system by freeing blocks.)

test fulldisk PASSED (10 of 10)
 (First uses all free blocks on disk for normal files and then makes sure small files can still be created. ***Note that the test will take a while since big files are created.***)

test stress FAILED (0 of 10)
 (Creates and deletes a lot of small files one at a time to make sure nothing breaks under a heavy load.)
 tester failed

test stress2 FAILED (0 of 10)
 (Creates and deletes a lot of small files 100 of them at a time to make sure nothing breaks under a heavy load. ***Note that the test will take a VERY long time since a lot of files are created.***)
 tester failed

test smallbig PASSED (10 of 10)
 (Creates bunch of small files; then creates bunch of big files to make sure normal files are not affected.)

test inode PASSED (10 of 10)
 (Uses all inodes in the file system; then repeatedly deleted and creates a file and makes sure the correct inode is reused for the new file.)

test inode2 PASSED (10 of 10)
 (Uses all inodes in the file system; then repeatedly deletes bunch of files and then creates that many files and makes sure the correct inodes are reused for the new files.)

test usertests FAILED (0 of 10)
 (Running standard tests to make sure you did not break anything for normal files. ***Note that the test will take a while since a lot of things are being tested.***)
 tester failed
